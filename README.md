code uses a JSON file to store the contacts. The add_contact function takes the name, phone, and email of the contact, creates a dictionary, and writes it to the JSON file. The search_contact function takes the name of the contact and searches for it in the JSON file. The view_contacts function reads the JSON file and prints all the contacts. The code provides a simple menu to the user to add, search, and view contacts. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.
